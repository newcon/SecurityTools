### [AppUse](https://appsec-labs.com/appuse)
#### AppUse is a VM (Virtual Machine) developed by AppSec Labs. It is a unique platform for mobile application security testing, Android and iOS applications and includes exclusive custom-made tools and scripts created by AppSec Labs.
AppUse Dashboard will allow user to perform action like: Disassemble APK, Decompile APK, Convert APK to Debug mode, View APK Manifest, Pull APK from device, Launch emulator/auto detect your testing device directly into the AppUse dashboard interface, Launch any tool you need for your penetration testing using the Tools section.

### [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool)
#### apktool tool is used for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications. It is also used for Disassembling resources to nearly original form (including resources.arsc, classes.dex, 9.png. and XMLs), Rebuilding decoded resources back to binary APK/JAR, Organizing and handling APKs that depend on framework resources anad Smali Debugging (Removed in 2.1.0 in favor of IdeaSmali).

### [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar)
#### Dex2Jar is a tool to work with Android “.dex” and Java “.class” files. As “.dex” files are compiled Android application code file. Android programs are compiled into “.dex” (Dalvik Executable) files, which are in turn zipped into a single “.apk” file on the device. The “.dex” files can be created automatically by Android, by translating the compiled applications written in the Java programming language.
The core feature of Dex2Jar is to convert the classes.dex file of an APK to classes.jar or vice versa. So, it is possible to view the source code of an Android application using any Java decompiler, and it is completely readable.

### [JD-GUI](http://jd.benow.ca/)
#### JD-GUI is a standalone graphical utility that displays Java source codes of “.class” files. 
Open “.jar” file with JD-GUI, where we can view the source code of the application which is Java classes in a readable format, and it is also very easy to navigate through the code.

### [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF)
#### Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing framework capable of performing static, dynamic and malware analysis. It can be used for effective and fast security analysis of Android, iOS and Windows mobile applications and support both binaries (APK, IPA & APPX ) and zipped source code. MobSF can do dynamic application testing at runtime for Android apps and has Web API fuzzing capabilities powered by CapFuzz, a Web API specific security scanner

### [Inspeckage](https://github.com/ac-pm/Inspeckage)
#### Inspeckage is a tool to offer dynamic analysis of Android applications. By applying hooks to functions of the Android API, Inspeckage will help you understand what an Android application is doing at runtime and moreover satart unexported activities (Xposed Module).

### [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/)
#### Cydia Impactor is a GUI tool for working with mobile devices. This tool is use for installing IPA files on iOS and APK files on Android. It also can help you exploit the series of Android "Master Key" vulnerabilities.

### [Keychain Dumper](https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper)
#### A tool to check which keychain items are available to an attacker once an iOS device has been jailbroken.

### [Class-Dump](http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/)
#### Class Dump is a command-line utility for examining the Objective-C runtime information stored in Mach-O files. It generates declarations for the classes, categories and protocols. Also we can look at the design of closed source applications, frameworks, and bundles. Watch the interfaces evolve between releases. Experiment with private frameworks, or see what private goodies are hiding in the AppKit. 

### [Clutch](https://github.com/KJCracks/Clutch)
#### Clutch is a high-speed iOS decryption tool. Clutch supports the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad as well as all iOS version, architecture types, and most binaries. Clutch is meant only for educational purposes and security research.Clutch requires a jailbroken iOS device with version 8.0 or greater.

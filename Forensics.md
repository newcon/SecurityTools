### [DEFT](http://www.deftlinux.net/download/)
#### DEFT is a Linux forensics tools which  contains bundles of tools which are free and open source. Mostly used for Incident Response, Cyber Intelligence and Computer Forensics scenarios. Amongst others, it contains tools for Mobile Forensics, Network Forensics, Data Recovery, and Hashing.
### [DD Imaging Tools](https://github.com/thefanclub/dd-utility)
#### DD tool is the Linux forensics tool which is used for imaging to external storage.Also, create bootable USB stick from ISO files of Linux Installation
### [Volatility](http://code.google.com/p/volatility/)
#### Volatility is the memory forensics framework and extensively used for incident response as well as malware analysis. By using this tool, you could dig information from running processes,registry hives,network sockets, network connection and DLLs. 
### [CAINE]( http://www.caine-live.net/) 
#### CAINE is the open source Linux distro created for digital forensics. It is basically provides an environment to integrate existing software tools as software modules in a user friendly manner.
### [LiME]( https://github.com/504ensicslabs/lime)
A Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) which allows for volatile memory acquisition from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as Android. This makes LiME unique as it is the first tool that allows for full memory captures on Android devices. It also minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes during acquisition, which allows it to produce memory captures that are more forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux memory acquisition.
## Free and Closed-Soure
### [HexEditorNeo](https://freehexeditorneo.com/)

### [AccessData Forensic Toolkit (FTK Imager)](http://marketing.accessdata.com/ftkimager4.2.0)
#### FTK Imager is a data preview and imaging tool used to acquire data (evidence) in a forensically sound manner by creating copies of data without making changes to the original evidence. It is used by security organizations (including law enforcement) for post-incident procedures.
### [Cellebrite UFED](https://www.cellebrite.com/en/products/ufed-ultimate/)
#### The Cellebrite 'Universal Forensic Extraction Device' (UFED) is a tool for mobile phone, smartphone, and PDA forensics. the UFED was compatible with over 2,500 mobile phones (including GSM, TDMA, CDMA, iDEN). The standard package containing several dozen phone cables. The UFED had an intergrated SIM reader, with Wireless connection options also being integrated, such as IR and Bluetooth.The UFED also supports native Apple iPOD Touch, and Apple iPHONE extraction on both 2G and 3G versions, as well as iOS4. This is clientless, and via a physical cable, and works on jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices. Subject data can be retrieved via logical extraction or via physical extraction (ie: hex dump). Moreover, all cable connectors from subject (source) side act as a write-blocker, being read only via the onboard hardware chipset. Extracted data includes basic handset data, the phonebook, SMS and MMS messages, SIM data, multimedia (e.g. images and videos stored on the phone), and time and date stamps.
